this is a physics simulation app. with a Go backend and a Threejs frontend

the goal is to simulate the position, velocity, size, shape, etc of objects accurately through time. focus on only mechanical solid things right now.

hosted on local host 8000 for now.
to do:
collision detection
forces
impact
gravitational force
