this is a physics simulation app. with a Go backend and a Threejs frontend

the goal is to simulate the position, velocity, size, shape, etc of objects accurately through time. focus on only mechanical solid things right now.

hosted on local host 8000 for now.
to do:
collision detection
forces
impact
gravitational force

gravity
create three body simulation


TO DO:
make simulating and viewing unrelated. no pause in simulation! save ALL frames in a file. and then just sent EVERYTHING over. and the viewer can view.
viewer: camera control. lock on objects. get their position, radius, and set to look at them.
