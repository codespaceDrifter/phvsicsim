# Oscillation

> A: amplitude. maximum displacement from origin. (m)  

> T: period. time required to complete one cycle  

> f: freqency. f = 1 / T. (Hz). cycles per second  

> SHM: simple harmonic motion, restoring force is linearly proportional to displacement

> $$x = Acos(wt + \emptyset)$$

> $$w^2 = \frac{k}{m}$$

> $$E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}k A^2$$

> $$v = \pm v_{\text{max}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{A^2}}$$

simple pendulum

>$$ F = -mg\theta$$

> $$F = -\frac{mg}{\ell}s$$

>$$\theta = \theta_{max} cos (wt + \emptyset)$$

>$$w = \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ell}}$$

>$$\tau = -mgh sin{\theta}$$
h is distance from center of mass to pivot, $\theta$ is angle between vertical and pendulum

# Fluid  

States: three common ones are solid, liquid, gas. Solid is fixed size fixed volume. Fluid is fixed size vary volume. Gas is vary size vary volume. Fluids include liquid and gas.  


> $$Density:\quad \rho = \frac{m}{v} \tag{$unit = kg/m^3$} $$
$$1 kg/m^3 = 1000 g/cm^3$$
> $$Pressure:\quad P = \frac{F}{A} \tag{$unit = Pa = N/m^2$}$$
In stable fluid, the pressure at the same depth is the same in all directions. Because if pressure is not the same, the fluid would flow. 
> $$P =P_0+ \rho gh$$
proof: 
$$ \begin{aligned}
P &= \frac{F}{A} \\
P &= \frac{\rho V g}{A} \\
P &= \frac{\rho A h g}{A} \\
P &= \rho gh\\

\end{aligned} $$

> $$ 1 atm = 101.3kPA $$


> Pascal's principle: if an external pressure is applied to a confined fluid, the pressure at every point within the fluid increases by that amount. 

> $$\text{Archimede's principle:} F_b = V_{\text{displaced}} \rho_{\text{fluid}} g$$
proof: 

$h_1$ is the distance from surface to top, $h_2$ is the distance from surface to bot

$$ \begin{aligned}
F_B &= F_{\text{bot}} - F_{\text{top}}\\
\Delta h &= h_2 - h_1 \\
F_B &= \rho g h_2 A - \rho g h_1 A \\
F_B &= \rho g V

\end{aligned} $$


>$$ \text{if fluid is incompressible:  } A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$$

Bernoulli's equation: assume flow is steady and laminar and fluid is incompressible. 

> $$P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g y = constant$$

proof:  
say in a closed fluid pipe, one side is P1 A1 at height y1 another is P2 A2 at height y2. length moved is $\Delta \ell$  
A1 = A2. W1 is work done by P1 to move from 1 to 2, W2 is work done by P2, W3 is work done by gravity  
total W equal change in kinetic energy  
$$ \begin{aligned}
W &= W_1 + W_2 + W_3 \\
W &= P_1 A \Delta \ell - P_2 A \Delta \ell - m g y_2 + m g y_1 \\
\frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 &= P_1 A \Delta \ell - P_2 A \Delta \ell - m g y_2 + m g y_1 \\
\because m &= \rho A \Delta \ell, \text{divide both sides by $A\Delta \ell$}\\
\frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 &= P_1 - P_2 - \rho g y_2 + \rho g y_1 \\
P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + \rho gy_1 &= P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 + \rho g y_2 



\end{aligned} $$

Unified Atomic Mass: roughly weight of one proton or neutron. C12 has 12 unified atomic mass (u)

M: g/mole. roughly equal to number of proton + neutron.
